# CustomerManager

Project for CS665

To build/run:

Ensure Maven is install locally (or use IDE with Maven integration):
http://maven.apache.org/install.html

Then:

``mvn clean compile exec:java``

Alternatively, I have uploaded a jar file to the root folder of the repository which can be downloaded and run without compilation.

To run this:

``java -jar CustomerManager-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar``

Tests can be run with:

``mvn test``
